# Packaging & Unboxing Experience Specification (br_packaging)

## 1. Overview
This document details the packaging and unboxing experience for the Airport Business Smartphone. The concept, titled "The Executive Briefcase," is designed to be a memorable, premium introduction to the Airport brand. It moves beyond a disposable box to a reusable, functional case that reflects the quality and purpose of the device itself.

## 2. The Packaging Concept: The Executive Briefcase

### 2.1 Design & Philosophy
- **Concept**: The packaging is a sleek, durable, and reusable case, much like a high-end watch box or a miniature briefcase. The unboxing is designed as a deliberate, layered journey of discovery.
- **Materials**:
  - **Exterior**: A shell made from bead-blasted, anodized recycled aluminum in a graphite color.
  - **Interior**: Lined with a soft-touch, high-density foam, precision-cut to house each component securely.
  - **Clasp**: A silent, satisfying magnetic clasp.
- **Reusability**: The box is designed to be a permanent travel or storage case for the phone and its essential accessories, reducing waste and adding long-term value.

### 2.2 The Unboxing Journey
1.  **First Look**: Upon opening the magnetic clasp, the user is greeted by the Airport Smartphone, presented centrally in its own molded compartment.
2.  **The Executive Kit**: Lifting the tray holding the phone reveals a second layer containing the unique welcome items: The Founder's Card and other elements of the Executive Kit.
3.  **The Power & Audio Hub**: The bottom layer is neatly organized into compartments for the charger, cable, and wired earphones.

## 5. Sustainability Commitment

- All paper products (guides, etc.) are made from 100% recycled materials.
- The internal trays are made from molded paper pulp instead of plastic.

## 6. Next Steps

2. Source vendors for the unique items like the metal Founder's Card and the leather cable organizer.
3. Design the graphics and layout for all printed materials.
4. Conduct user testing on the unboxing experience to refine the journey and presentation.
