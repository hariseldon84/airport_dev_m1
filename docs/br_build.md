# Build & Design Specifications (br_build)

## 1. Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the physical construction, materials, form factor, ergonomics, and durability standards for the Airport Business Smartphone. The design philosophy prioritizes professional aesthetics, in-hand comfort, and long-term reliability.

## 2. Materials & Finishes

### 2.1 Grade 5 Titanium Alloy Frame (Ti-6Al-4V)
- **Properties**: High strength-to-weight ratio, superior corrosion resistance, excellent rigidity to prevent bending.
- **Manufacturing**: CNC machined from a solid billet for precision and structural integrity. A sub-frame of stainless steel will be used for antenna passthrough and component mounting.
- **Finish**: Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) coating in matte Space Black and Silver finishes for enhanced scratch resistance and a non-reflective, professional look.

### 2.2 Zirconia Ceramic Back Panel
- **Properties**: Extreme scratch resistance (9 on Mohs scale), premium feel, excellent thermal dissipation, and transparent to RF signals for optimal antenna performance.
- **Manufacturing**: Formed from a high-purity zirconia powder, sintered at high temperatures, and precision-milled. The surface is bead-blasted to create a micro-texture for a matte, fingerprint-resistant finish.
- **Color Options**: Ceramic White, Graphite Grey.

### 2.3 Display Cover Glass: Gorilla Glass Victus 3
- **Properties**: Best-in-class drop and scratch performance. An oleophobic coating is applied to resist fingerprints and smudges.
- **Integration**: The glass is seamlessly integrated with the titanium frame with a minimal 0.2mm bezel gap, sealed with a high-strength, waterproof adhesive.

### 2.4 Sapphire Crystal Components
- **Application**: Used for the rear camera lens array and the front-facing biometric sensors to ensure maximum scratch resistance and optical clarity.

## 3. Form Factor & Dimensions

### 3.1 Design Philosophy
- The form factor is optimized to balance a large, productive 6.7" display with comfortable one-handed operation. The weight is carefully balanced to ensure the center of gravity rests in the user's palm.

### 3.2 Technical Specifications
- **Height**: 160.8 mm
- **Width**: 75.1 mm
- **Thickness**: 8.5 mm
- **Weight**: 200 grams
- **Screen-to-body Ratio**: 92%
- **Bezels**: Symmetrical 1.5mm bezels on all four sides.

## 4. Ergonomics & Haptics

### 4.1 In-Hand Feel & Usability
- **Contoured Edges**: The titanium frame features a continuous curve with a 2.5D radius that transitions smoothly into the front glass and rear ceramic panel, eliminating sharp edges.
- **Corner Radius**: A 12mm corner radius provides a comfortable grip without digging into the palm.
- **Anti-Slip Coating**: The PVD coating on the frame has a slightly textured finish to improve grip and prevent accidental drops.

### 4.2 Control Placement
- **Power Button & Volume Rocker**: Located on the right side, positioned for easy access with the thumb (right-handed) or index finger (left-handed).
- **Multi-Mode Privacy Switch**: A tactile, rotary switch located on the upper left side for deliberate and easy access without looking.
- **Button Feel**: All buttons are engineered for a satisfying, tactile click with a travel distance of 0.7mm and an actuation force of 150gf.

### 4.3 Advanced Haptics
- **Actuator**: A large, high-precision linear resonant actuator (LRA) is used to provide crisp, localized haptic feedback for typing, notifications, and system interactions.
- **Software Integration**: The BeeHive AI will intelligently adjust haptic feedback intensity based on the context and user preferences.

## 5. Durability & Reliability

### 5.1 Ingress Protection: IP68
- **Rating**: The device is certified to withstand submersion in up to 1.5 meters of fresh water for 30 minutes.
- **Sealing**: All ports, buttons, and seams are protected with custom rubber gaskets and waterproof adhesives. The SIM tray features a dual-gasket design.

### 5.2 Military Standard Certification: MIL-STD-810H
- The device is engineered and tested to pass the following MIL-STD-810H procedures:
  - **Transit Drop (Method 516.8)**: Survives 26 drops from 1.2 meters onto a plywood surface.
  - **Shock (Method 514.8)**: Withstands mechanical shocks during transportation and use.
  - **Vibration (Method 514.8)**: Operates reliably under various vibration profiles.
  - **Temperature Shock (Method 503.7)**: Endures rapid temperature changes from -20°C to 60°C.
  - **Humidity (Method 507.6)**: Operates in up to 95% humidity.

### 5.3 Structural Integrity
- **Internal Reinforcements**: Key internal components are mounted on a magnesium sub-frame to absorb shock and prevent flexing.
- **Corner Protection**: The corners of the titanium frame are internally reinforced to provide extra protection against drops.
