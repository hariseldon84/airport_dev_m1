## FAQ

**Q: I've only designed Android apps, not system UI. Can I apply?**  
A: Depends on complexity. If you've designed complex, productivity-focused apps with deep understanding of Android patterns, possibly. Simple apps don't qualify.

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**  
A: No, but understanding technical constraints and how to hand off to developers is essential.

**Q: What if my portfolio is under NDA?**  
A: Describe projects in detail, show process work, or create password-protected portfolios. We understand NDAs.

**Q: Do you provide user research?**  
A: We'll collaborate on research, but you should be comfortable with competitive analysis and making informed design decisions.

**Q: Can I work with other designers or a team?**  
A: We prefer a single lead designer, but if you have a team that works well together, we're open to it.

**Q: Will my designs actually be built?**  
A: Yes. This is a serious hardware product launching to market. Your designs will be implemented by our development team.

**Q: How much design freedom do I have?**  
A: Significant freedom within the business-focused mandate. We want innovation, not just copying existing patterns.

**Q: What about motion design and animations?**  
A: You should specify animations and micro-interactions. If you can create animation prototypes, even better.
