## FAQ

**Q: I've only worked on Android apps. Can I apply?**  
A: No. This role requires deep system-level experience. App development does not qualify.

**Q: I've modified a custom ROM. Does that count as AOSP experience?**  
A: It depends. If you've made system-level modifications, built from source, and integrated hardware, possibly. Simple theming or app modifications do not count.

**Q: Do I need to relocate?**  
A: No, this is 100% remote. However, you may need to travel 1-2 times for hardware integration milestones.

**Q: Will I work with a team or solo?**  
A: You'll be the primary AOSP developer, but you'll collaborate closely with hardware engineers, security specialists, and other software developers.

**Q: What if the hardware isn't ready?**  
A: We'll provide emulators and development boards. Work can proceed on reference hardware initially.

**Q: Can I use this in my portfolio?**  
A: Yes, after product launch and with appropriate permissions. Details in contract.

**Q: What about IP ownership?**  
A: All code developed belongs to the company. You'll sign IP assignment agreements.

**Q: How stable is this project? Will funding run out?**  
A: This is a well-funded, serious hardware venture with backing for the full development cycle and beyond.
