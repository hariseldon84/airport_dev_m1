## Part 13: Sample Language

### Opening the Call
"Thank you for joining us today. Airport is building a premium business-focused smartphone with a custom Android-based operating system. We're in the process of selecting a development partner for the complete software stack, and we're excited to learn more about your team and experience. 

Before we dive in, I should mention that we have proprietary technology and features we can't discuss in detail until we have an NDA in place. Today's call is about understanding your capabilities, experience, and approach at a high level. Does that work for you?"

### When Asked for Specifics
"That's an excellent question and definitely something we'll need to discuss in detail. However, it involves proprietary aspects of our technology, so we'd need to have an NDA signed before we can go deeper. If we both feel there's a good fit after today, that would be our next step."

### Closing the Call
"Thank you so much for your time today and for sharing your experience. We have a few other partners we're speaking with this week. We'll review our notes and if we'd like to proceed to the next step, we'll send over an NDA and schedule a more detailed technical discussion. We should have a decision for you within the next [X] days. Do you have any final questions for us?"

### Follow-Up Email (If Proceeding)
"Thank you for the productive conversation yesterday. After our internal review, we'd like to proceed to the next step with your team. 

Attached is our mutual NDA for your review. Once executed, we'll schedule a detailed technical discussion and share comprehensive project specifications.

Please let us know if you have any questions about the NDA or if you'd like to suggest any modifications. We look forward to continuing our discussions."

### Follow-Up Email (If Declining)
"Thank you for taking the time to speak with us yesterday about our project. We appreciated learning about your team and experience.

After careful consideration, we've decided to proceed with other partners whose experience more closely aligns with our specific technical requirements. We were impressed by [mention something positive], and we'll keep your information on file for potential future opportunities.

We wish you and your team all the best."
